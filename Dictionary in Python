# Dictionary object can be created by using {} are by calling dict() function.
# dictionary is a mutable object.
# insertion order is preserved.
# indexing and slicing is not supported.
# duplicate keys are not allowed.
# duplicate values are allowed.
# dictionary is a collection of homogeneous and heterogeneous keys and values.
# dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
# the key and value pair are called items.

# d={}
# type(d)
# d=['a':10,'b':20,'c':30]
# print(d)
# d['a']=60
# print(d)


# e={"Name":"Raj","id1":101, "Dept":20, "Salary":70000}
# print(e)
# print(e["Dept"])
# d=e.get("Salary")
# print(d)
# e["Salary"]=80000
# print(e)
# e["subject"]="python"
# print(e)
# for p in e.keys():
#     print(p)
# for p in e.values():
#     print(p)
# for p,q in e.items():
#     print(p,q)        
# for s in e.items():
#     print(s)       
# for s in e.items():
#     print(s[0],s[1])
# r=sorted(list(e.keys()))
# print(r)        
   
# Dictionary comprehension: the concepts of generating elements into dictionary object by writing some logic in the dictionary oios called as dictionary comprehension. 
By using the dictionary comprehension we can reduce the number of lines of code
