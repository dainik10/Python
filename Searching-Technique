# Searching techniques in python:- python supports 2 type of Searching Technique:-
# 1. Linear search
# 2. Binary Search

# Linear Search:- in the libnear Search we are going to compare key element with the each and every element of the list.
# If the element is found then it will return the index position of the corresponding element.
# If the element is not available then it will return -1. That is -1 is indicated as element is not found.
# In the Linear Search we are going to compare each and every element with the key, so this algorithm will take more time to execute and time complexity also more.

def linearSearch(l,key):
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if(l[i]==key):
            return i
    return -1
l=list(map(int,input("Enter the list of elements:").split()))
key=int(input("Enter the key element:"))
s=linearSearch(l,key)
if(s==-1):
    print("Element is not found")
else:
    print("Element is found at index position:",s)
