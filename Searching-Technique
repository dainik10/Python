# Searching techniques in python:- python supports 2 type of Searching Technique:-
# 1. Linear search
# 2. Binary Search

# Linear Search:- in the libnear Search we are going to compare key element with the each and every element of the list.
# If the element is found then it will return the index position of the corresponding element.
# If the element is not available then it will return -1. That is -1 is indicated as element is not found.
# In the Linear Search we are going to compare each and every element with the key, so this algorithm will take more time to execute and time complexity also more.

def linearSearch(l,key):
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if(l[i]==key):
            return i
    return -1
l=list(map(int,input("Enter the list of elements:").split()))
key=int(input("Enter the key element:"))
s=linearSearch(l,key)
if(s==-1):
    print("Element is not found")
else:
    print("Element is found at index position:",s)


# Binary Search:- In the Binary Search first we have to sort the elements.
# calculate low and high values.
# low=0, high=len(l)-1
# calculate mid index position value. that is mid=(low+high)//2
# based on the mid position find out middle value in the list and compare with the key value, if the middle value in the list and comapre middle value with the key value,
#if middle values is less than key value then incriement the low , if middle values is greater than key values then decrement the high value with 1, 
#if two condition are not satisified that will be indicated as middle value and key values are equal then return the index position.
# If the element is not available then this algorithm will return -1.
