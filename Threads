# Thread class is a predefined class which is defined in threading model.
# Threads can be executed group through start() method of thread class.

#Multi-Threading Concept:-
import threading
class x(threading.Thread):
    def run(self):
        for p in range(1,101):
            print(p)
class y(threading.Thread):
    def run(self):
        for q in range(101,201):
            print(q)
x1 = x()
x1.start()
y1 = y()
y1.start()
