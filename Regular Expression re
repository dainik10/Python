# Regular expression:-
# If u want to represent a group of strings according to a particular format or pattern then we should go for regular expression
# Regular expression is a declarative mechanism to represent a group of strings according to a particular format or pattern.
# we can write a regular expression to represent the mobile number.
# we can write a regular expression to represent the email id.
# The main important application of regular expression are:-
# 1. to develop validation logic.
# 2. to develop pattern matching applications. ex, ctrl F in windows and grep in unix.
# 3. to develop translator like compilers, interpreters, assemblers etc.
# 4. to develop digital circuits.
# 5. to develop communication protocols like TCP, UDP, etc.
# we can develop regular expression based applications by using python re module.
# This module contains several inbuilt functions to use regular expression very easily in our applications.

# 1. compile:-
# re module contains compile() function to compile the pattern into a regex object.

# 2. findIter:-
# return an iterator object which yields match objects of every match.
# on match object we can call the following methods:- start, end, group.

import re
c=0
p=re.finditer("ab","ababababab")
for m in p:
    c+=1
    print(m.start(),"...",m.end(),"...",m.group())
print("The number of occurences: ",c)
