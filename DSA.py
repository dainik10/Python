# DATA STRUCTURES:-
# -----------------

# --> Performing manupulation on data is called as data structures.
# -- > Different manupulation on data are:-

# 1) Storing the data 
# 2) Updating the data 
# 3) Retriving the data
# 4) Deleting the data


# --> Various data structure concept are:-

# 1) Stack
# 2) Queue
# 3) Searching ans Sorting technique
# 4) Linkedlist
# 5) Trees
# 6) Graph

# # lINKED LIST:-
#   --------------

# -> It is a collection of nodes and everynode will be connected to the next node .

# ==> It is clasified into three types.

# 1) Single Linked list
# 2) Double Linked list
# 3) Circular Linked list


# # Single Linkedlist:-
# ---------------------

# ---> it is a collection of nodes and everynode will contain two fields 
# 1) data 
# 2) next

# ---> The various operations we are going to perform such as :-
# 1) Creating the node
# 2) Inserting the data into the node
# 3) Displaying the data present in the node
# 4) Adding the node
# 5) Deleting the node
# 6) Displaying the data in the reverse order.
